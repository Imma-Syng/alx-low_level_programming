Write a script that generates the assembly code (Intel syntax) of a C code and save it in an output file.
-The C file name will be saved in the variable $CFILE.
-The output file should be named the same as the C file, but with the extension .s instead of .c.
-Example: if the C file is main.c, the output file should be main.s
